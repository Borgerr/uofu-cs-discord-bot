# Contributing Guidelines

Feel free to contribute to any part of the project. We prefer contributions made by current U students, but anyone can
submit.

We use the issues system to track problems and feature requests, and when you want to make a contribution go ahead and 
create a PR that is attached to that issue with your fixes/features.
